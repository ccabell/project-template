Doctor: Let's discuss how we can incorporate NEOCUTIS Neo Body 200ml into your treatment plan.
Patient: I've read mixed reviews about NEOCUTIS Neo Restore (sachets). Is it right for me?
Doctor: The texture of NEOCUTIS BioCream Firm (15/50ml/Riche) is excellent for post‑procedure recovery.
Patient: I also saw information on RADIESSE LIDO 2X1.5CC US—would that help with volume loss?
Doctor: Potentially yes, though VIAL 1ST 100Unit US (Aesthetik) is better for glabellar lines.
Patient: Good to know. What about AccuVein HF580 Base—will you use that during injections?
Doctor: Absolutely; AccuVein helps me visualize veins so we avoid bruising.
Patient: Then let’s proceed with NEOCUTIS Bio Gel Firm (15/50/200ml) for my nightly routine.
