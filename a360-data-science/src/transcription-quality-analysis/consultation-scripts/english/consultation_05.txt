Doctor: Before laser resurfacing, we'll prep with NEOCUTIS After Care 15ml to minimize downtime.
Patient: Can NEOCUTIS Lumiere Firm be applied the same evening?
Doctor: Wait 48 hours, then introduce Lumiere Firm Riche 15ml around the eyes.
Patient: I'd like cheek volume; is VIAL 1ST 100Unit US appropriate?
Doctor: That's actually botulinum toxin; for volume we'll use RADIESSE LIDO 1X1.5CC US SAM.
Patient: Understood. For redness control, would NEOCUTIS Reactive+ RB 30ml be overkill?
Doctor: Reactive+ RB is optimal postâ€‘laser; it calms erythema quickly.
Patient: Are there peptide alternatives?
Doctor: NEOCUTIS Journee Firm 50ml offers peptides plus SPF for daytime recovery.
Patient: Makes sense. And you'll map vessels with AccuVein HF580 Stand, right?
Doctor: Correct, the stand keeps the AV500 steady while I work.
Patient: Thank you, looking forward to it.
