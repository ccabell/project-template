Doctor: Starting with Radiesse should improve mid‑face structure.
Patient: How is plain Radiesse different from RADIESSE LIDO 1X1.5CC US SAM?
Doctor: The Lido version includes lidocaine for comfort; same calcium hydroxylapatite base.
Patient: Post‑filler, I plan to use NEOCUTIS Perle RB 30ml for pigmentation.
Doctor: Perfect. Also include NEOCUTIS Lumiere Firm (4/15/200ml) for peri‑orbital smoothing.
Patient: Do we still use NEOCUTIS After Care 15ml/200ml right after lasers?
Doctor: Yes, and NEOCUTIS Athena‑labeled products, especially NEOCUTIS NeoCleanse Gentle/Exfoliating, keep skin calm.
Patient: Great—shall we finalize with AccuVein to guide injections?
Doctor: Definitely, along with a touch of aura and mild VIAL 1ST 100Unit US if dynamic lines appear.
